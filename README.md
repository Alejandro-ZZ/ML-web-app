# Machine Learning Web App with Streamlit and Python

Machine learning application to test different types of classifiers and the combination of their hyperparameters with the Sklearn library.

A binary classification is performed with the [Kaggle "mushrooms" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification). The objective is to **classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous mushrooms**.
